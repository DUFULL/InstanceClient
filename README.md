Thanks to [Sinuce](http://denmarkinminecraft.com/profile/4517920) for creating the design for the GuiButtons above.

The purpose of [INDEX1.7.10.md](https://github.com/instance01/InstanceClient/blob/master/INDEX1.7.10.md) is to keep track of the mod locations (in this case only for 1.7.10 though), but it doesn't contain any mods that don't require changing vanilla Minecraft code (obviously). I'll add a INDEX1.8.md when I find the time.


Uses DarkStorm's GUI API (included) and has a Console included.
