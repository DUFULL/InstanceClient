InstanceClient
==============

Modded Minecraft Client with a few Utilities.



The purpose of [INDEX.md](https://github.com/instance01/InstanceClient/blob/master/INDEX.md) is to keep track of the mod locations, but it doesn't contain any mods that don't require changing vanilla Minecraft code (obviously).


Uses DarkStorm's GUI API (included) and has a Console included.
